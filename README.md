2D Dual Contouring in JS

A simple implementation of www.frankpetterson.com/publications/dualcontour/dualcontour.pdf in 2D on an uniform grid in JS
I'm creating it mostly to get a better understanding of this algorithm.

Acknowledgement: the phaser.js file in the project is the Phaser library (http://phaser.io/) used as a renderer. It's a separate project, not owned by me. It's included in the repo for simplicity.
